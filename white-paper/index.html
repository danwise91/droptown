					<h3>What is DropTown?</h3>
					<p>Hello there! Are you new around these parts? Well, let me be the first to welcome you to DropTown!</p>
					<p>Now you’re probably wondering what the devil is this strange new project. Is it just another run-of-the-mill PFP collection? Well, while we don’t want to brag about how awesome the art is, DropTown is in-fact providing a new form of NFT utility.</p>
					<p>DropTown is fueling a whole new era in web 3.0 allowing anyone to create their own business through NFT launchpads.</p>
					<p>We’re strong believers in digital economies and that’s what DropTown supports. Want to hear more? Let’s get started then...</p>

					<h3>Webpreneur 3.0</h3>
					<p>Loyal citizens of DropTown are entitled to their own plot of digital land through DropTown.</p>
					<p>But these aren’t your everyday plots of digital land…there is something special behind them.</p>
					<p>Owning a DropTown land NFT, or a Town, as we call them, allows you to create and modify your very own NFT launchpad!</p>
					<p>Your town is yours to do with as you wish! You can set your own fee, pick which projects to host, and customize the website of your launchpad with our user-friendly editor.</p>
					<p>We're ushering in a new era of entrepreneurship in Web3 through a decentralized model giving NFT holders a headstart in creating the business they've envisioned. </p>
					<p>Regardless if you’re a solo entrepreneur, a DAO, or just a group of buddies looking to start something new, DropTown can get you started in the fastest way possible.</p>

		<section id="Why-create-an-NFT-launchpad">

			<div class="mc">
				<div class="ic">
					<h3>Why create an NFT launchpad?</h3>
					<p>Is running an NFT launchpad profitable? Well, new project ideas spring up every day and creators are looking for the best way to bring their collections to the public. While some have the technical support to do it on their own, many do not and thus seek out launchpads.</p>
					<p>NFT launchpads play a vital role in the future of projects because they not only help teams bring their collections and platforms to market but also serve as a means to assure buyers that they’re making a purchase from a reputable source.</p>
					<p>To put it simply, DropTown is decentralizing launchpad ownership! A world where anyone has the power to create and run a launchpad the way they want.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Does it cost a lot to build your own NFT launchpad?</strong><br />
						You’ll need to account for development, marketing, and basically convince projects to launch with you. DropTown is helping to relieve some stress by supplying a wide range of tools and services that you need to build a successful launchpad business.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>How can you use your launchpad?</strong><br />
						Only you hold all the power to your launchpad so you can use it as you wish! Use it mint projects you select (or even your own), set your own fees, and develop your own brand. We're well aware that other types of web3 businesses exist and there are many more to emerge, which is why we intend to bring more tools and features to cater to an array of entrepreneurs. 
					</p>
					<p>To start, we plan to make DropTown a multi-chain platform. Why is that? Because all ecosystems deserve the chance to introduce fresh projects to them and we want to provide users with options.</p>

					<h3>B2D (Business-to-DAO)</h3>
					<p>DropTown is enabling a new type of decentralized service that we like to call "B2D" or Business-to-DAO.</p>
					<p>While the platform enables anyone to launch NFT collections of their choosing, DAOs and communities can come together to use DropTown's platform to benefit their organizations and expand their brand. </p>
					<p>Existing DAOs and NFT communities have the opportunity to utilize the DropTown platform to create their own NFT launchpad to bring their own new collections to market or those created by partners and community members. </p>
					<p>This allows decentralized organizations to utilize their brand in a whole new way while opening up a new revenue stream and providing a new way to interact with communities, both internal and external. </p>

					<h3>Seeking Launchpads Bulletin Board</h3>
					<p>Any launchpad owners looking for projects to host can turn to our bulletin board where projects are listed that are looking to launch. </p>
					<p>The contact details of each project will be provided along with details of the project, preferred blockchain, and the targeted release date. Launchpad owners and projects can contact each other and negotiate out a deal. </p>
					<p>The Bulletin Board is DropTown's method to bring projects and launchpad owners together to converse and figure out how the release will work. </p>
					<p>Please note that this is NOT the only method to find projects to onboard. Owners may use other methods detailed in <a href="#DropTown-marketing-services" class="g-link">DropTown marketing services.</a></p>

					<h3>Project Auctions</h3>
					<p>Project Auctions are reserved for upcoming mints for projects that are considered "highly-hyped" or are being conducted by big named teams.</p>
					<p>Town owners are able to engage in a "bid" to reserve their Town for this specific project. The winner of the auction will host the mint and share in the profits generated during the mint with the project.</p>
					<p>We felt auctions would be most appropriate for these types of projects considering it would greatly reduce the influx of message requests from Town owners and narrows it down to only Town owners serious about hosting the project.</p>
					<p>A starting bid will be provided by the project. The winning bid will sent to DropTown in exchange for the reservation spot. </p>
					<p class="info">
						Failure to conduct the mint will result in penalties and possible bans for both the project and Town Owner. please not that only vetted projects are eligible for auctions.

		<section id="Project-Onboarding-Process">

			<div class="mc">
				<div class="ic">
					<h3>Project Onboarding Process</h3>
					<p>To begin the onboarding of a project you plan to host you'll first need to create a request to book the project.</p>
					<p>First go to your Town Square and click on the "Project Onboarding" button from the main menu.</p>
					<p>Next, you'll select if the project is "yours" or an "external project". If the project is external then you'll proceed to the next step. If it's your own then you'll just need to fill out the project details, select the blockchain you want to launch on, and upload your needed materials (as explained further below).</p>
					<p>From here you'll need to provide details about the project such as it's main email, minting date, blockchain of choice, and other details.</p>
					<p>The project will receive a verification email where they'll be prompted to login to their existing DropTown account or create one if they haven't.</p>
					<p class="info">
						No NFTs are required for a basic DropTown account
					</p>
					<p>Once the project owner(s) have logged into their account they'll be taken to a registration page where they'll be prompted to upload all assets for their NFT mint via layer, confirm the minting date, select any dev tools they wish to use provided by the Town owner, and confirm the blockchain the mint will take place on.</p>
					<p>After the form is submitted the mint will be confirmed, added to the <a href="#Minting-Calendar" class="g-link">Minting-Calendar</a>, and the project owners will be taken back to the <a href="#My Drops" class="g-link">Standard Menu [All DropTown Users]</a>.</p>
					<p>From this menu, the project owner will receive a notice in their inbox that their mint is scheduled and dev tools available if the Town owner has any purchased. These tools can be accessed under the <a href="#My Drops" class="g-link">My Drops</a> menu. </p>
					<p class="info">
						After a project's mint is finished, access to these devs tools will become LOCKED for the project owner(s) until another mint is scheduled. Town owners have direct access to these tools 24/7.
					</p>
					<p>If changes are needed, the project must contact the Town owner who can adjust the minting details through the Town Square dashboard. </p>
					<p>Prior to the mint, project owners will be alerted to get in contact with NFT marketplaces to get their project listed post mint. Depending on the selected blockchain for the mint, a selection of NFT marketplaces will be delivered to their inbox with DropTown partnered marketplaces highlighted.</p>
					<p>If you're onboarding your own project then you'll receive this email directly in your inbox right after the form is submitted. </p>
					<p>Partnered marketplaces are trustworthy parties whom we have a working relationship with. Projects can submit a request to these marketplaces in a streamlined fashion and get their listing straighten out. </p>
					<p class="info">
						Please note that while not every non-partnered marketplace is malicious we do highly recommend you look into any third party store fronts that you're interested in doing business with.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the mint is completed, the hosted project will directly receive their entitled funds from the mint, while the Town owner receives their cut after DropTown fees are taken.

					<h3>DROP Utilities</h3>
					<p>DROP is the blood that runs throughout the veins of DropTown. You can spend DROP in multiple ways to upgrade your launchpad and unlock new designs, templates, and dev tools for your launchpad.</p>
					<p>Projects will have the option to accept DROP for mints or the native token on the blockchain they’re launching on. Choosing DROP payments will incur a reduced platform fee.</p>
					<p>We strive to provide as many ways you can use DROP on the DropTown platform to give our token utility and reduce selling pressure. Here are some ways you’ll be able to spend DROP:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Minting NFTs</li>
						<li>Upgrading your launchpad</li>
						<li>Discord bots</li>
						<li>Whitelist management tools</li>
						<li>Interactive experiences for minters (music while minting anyone?)</li>
						<li>New template designs</li>
						<li>Marketing/promotion services</li>
						<li>Minters for newly added blockchains</li>

					<h3>Citizen NFT Utilities</h3>
					<p>
						Each citizen NFT comes with unique artwork done by <em>artist name</em> . There are 5 rarities: <strong>common</strong>, <strong>uncommon</strong>, <strong>rare</strong>, <strong>epic</strong>, and <strong>legendary</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Holding a citizen NFT will grant you access to the Town Square dashboard and also the Town NFT sale. If you hold 1 citizen NFT then you’ll be guaranteed 1 Town once the sale goes live. The order holders can enter the sale will depend on the rarity of your NFT, legendaries will go first followed by epics, and so on and so forth.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Citizen NFT will provide you access to the exclusive Town Square dashboard which is only for NFT holders. You may not be able to build your launchpad until you have a Town, but you’ll be able to stake your citizen NFT and poke around in the upcoming menu previews.
					</p>
					<p>
						Citizen NFTs come with additional benefits including allocation of our DROP token airdrop in the coming months, breeding, and NFT staking to passively earn DROP tokens.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even more utilities are planned for your citizens down the road...you may even see them come to life.

					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
						Each Town may appear as a colorful metropolis but under the hood, they’re a unique key to your launchpad.
					</p>
					<p>
						By simply holding the Town NFT in your wallet, you’ll be able to create the website for your launchpad. All changes, upgrades, and designs are saved on-chain and are associated with your NFT.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your launchpad platform really takes off then this means your Town NFT may fetch a MUCH higher price on secondary markets if you ever decide to sell. Essentially you’ll have the freedom to sell off your business if you ever wish to.
					</p>
					<p>
						All Town NFTs also come with a rarity, this rarity determines the maximum “upgrades” you can give your town. Upgrading costs DROP tokens and will allow you to host more NFT mints each week.

					<h3>Hosting projects with your Town</h3>
					<p>
						After acquiring a Town NFT and setting up your website, you’re then ready to start hosting projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can find projects in various ways including but not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Promoting your Town on social media</li>
						<li>Executing your own marketing campaigns</li>
						<li>Checking our Discord channels</li>
						<li>Referencing the “Seeking Launchpad” bulletin board in the Town Square</li>
						<li>Bidding on popular projects</li>
						<li>Purchasing DropTown marketing services</li>
						<li>Reaching out to projects directly</li>
						<li>Hosting your own mints</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Once you find a project to host, you’ll then have to go through a multi-step process to confirm the project and get them scheduled for the mint. More information on how to do this in <a href="#Project-Onboarding-Process" class="g-link">Project Onboarding Process</a>. 
					</p>
					<p>
						We also HIGHLY recommend you to get a DropTown “Seal of Approval” (more on this in ) <a href="#The-DropDAO" class="g-link">The DropDAO</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						All owners are free to <strong>set their own</strong> hosting fee. You have the freedom to choose to have minters pay via $DROP or the blockchain token the mint will occur on. If you choose DROP, the DropTown fixed fee will be reduced.
					</p>
					<p>
						DropTown will take a fixed 10% rate from the total profits at the end of a mint for hosted projects across all Towns that do not pay in DROP and 5% that pay in DROP. A portion of these fees will be circulated back into our ecosystem with a percentage burned. Details on these exact percentages will be available as development continues.
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						Please note that these percentages are subject to change depending on market conditions and as development progresses.
					</p>
					<p>
						You’re free to host any projects you wish as long as you follow the DropDAO compliance rules.

					<h3>Using your Town to launch your own collections</h3>
					<p>
						Your Town does not need to always be used to host other projects. All Town owners can 100% use their launchpad to host mints for their own collections.
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						DropTown rates still apply depending on Drop/Non-Drop mints
					</p>
					<p>
						Having this flexibility is great because it eliminates the need for a "middleman" when needing to apply to exiting launchpad platforms or needing to go through the expenses of creating your own mint. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Not only is DropTown aiming for any individual, may they be artists, game developers, entrepreneurs, or something else entirely, to not only launch their NFT collections but also quickly set up a Web3 business independently. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Considering the project you're launching here is YOURS you'll not be required to enter your rates during the <a href="#Project-Onboarding-Process" class="g-link">Project Onboarding Process</a> and <strong>can keep all the profits</strong> from the mint. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Future DropTown developments will further explore the ability to integrate more templates and tools that will make creating the proper website or metaverse for the most popular types of Web3 businesses.

		<section id="How-the-DropDAO-works">

			<div class="mc">
				<div class="ic">
					<h3>How the DropDAO works</h3>
					<p>
						The governing board of all DropTown is known as the DropDAO. If you hold a Gen0 Citizen NFT then you’re in it!
					</p>
					<p class="info">
						Upon the release of the $DROP token we may take into consideration a minimal amount of DROP held in order to join the DAO as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						The DropDAO plays a big role in DropTown as they are the decision makers as far as what projects will receive the coveted “Seal of DropTown Approval”
					</p>
					<p>
						The seal is a badge acknowledging that a project has been audited, certified and deemed trustworthy by the DropDAO.
					</p>
					<p>
						Town owners can proudly display the badge, as a way to assure minters that the project won’t just take off with their hard earned crypto, as the experts behind the DropDAO have given the “thumbs up” on the team and project.
					</p>
					<p>
						When a citizen of DropTown submits a vetting request for a project, it will go directly to the DropDAO where experts will analyze the project from top to bottom, leaving no stone unturned.
					</p>
					<p>
						For their time and hard work, those who helped in vetting the project will be compensated with some $DROP.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every member of the DropDAO committee is looking to make the ecosystem a better place and plays an essential role in the development of DropTown by voting on important decisions. All members have the ability to vote on crucial directions to take.

		<section id="What-if-a-rug-pull-happens">

			<div class="mc">
				<div class="ic">
					<h3>What if a rug pull happens</h3>
					<p>
						No one likes rug pullers, they’re a nasty bunch and we can all agree on that!
					</p>
					<p>
						Through our decentralized model, DropDAO, and loyal community we aim to combat rug pulls and bad actors.
					</p>
					<p>
						Obtaining the DropTown seal of approval is a great way to ensure your minters will walk away happy with their new NFTs without any big issues occurring. However, all DropTown owners need to understand they come with a high degree of responsibility.
					</p>
					<p>
						While it’s highly recommended to obtain a seal, it’s not required. If you do not obtain one, then you incur 100% responsibility for the mint. Think of the seal as insurance in case something goes wrong.
					</p>
					<p>
						If your town is found to have hosted a rug pull or scam project, you’ll incur a penalty badge which is displayed on your DropTown listing. This does not mean you are restricted from hosting further mints, but it’s a measure for us to make future projects AWARE of the incident that occurred in your town.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the event that you incur a total of 3 penalty badges, your launchpad will be suspended until further notice.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, just because you’ve had a penalty in the past does not mean it sticks with you forever. Those Town owners who display proper responsibility; such as obtaining seals of approval before a mint, can appeal their case to the DAO. If the DropDAO approves the appeal your penalty badge(s) will be removed.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to rug pull penalties, your town may also receive penalties if found to have displayed media of offensive or extremely vulgar taste. Unlike a rug pull though, this will typically receive a warning and if the behavior is repeated or not resolved, a penalty badge will be given.

					<h3>Put a unique domain to your DropTown website</h3>
					<p>
					Roughly sometime after all citizen and Town NFTs have been minted, users are able to host NFT drops, and we’ve ironed out any bugs so everyone is having a near-flawless experience, we’ll begin work on our domain service system.
					</p>
					<p>
					Town owners will have the option to spend their DROP tokens on a subscription that will allow them to host their website under a domain they own. Plans will include 1-2 year subscriptions with auto-renew options.
					</p>
					<p>
					For example, the default domain for any town will be something along the lines of “www.drop.town/town112”. But after purchasing a domain hosting subscription you'll be able to set a domain like FalconHawkDrops.eth where your site will exist for anyone to visit. 
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>.drop Domains</strong><br />
						We'll also be creating our own brand of domain names ending in .drop
					</p>
					<p>
					Those who sign up for the first time for our domain services will receive a FREE .drop domain of their choice to start with.
					</p>
					<p>
					.drop domains will be purchasable using DROP tokens under our domain services menu. Those who want to rep a DropTown exclusive domain can create and claim every .drop domain as an NFT.
					</p>
					<p>
					Regardless if you use .drop, .eth, or another domain, we want to provide all Town owners with the ability to run their site the way they wish under the URL they want.
